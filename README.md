# Mario-64-Randomizer
This program is meant for SM64 races. It generates a sequence of Stars that players will try to get as fast as possible. The order of the stars is up to each player.

# How to Use it?
Just download the executable file in the Release section. Double click to run it. Click on "New Seed" to generate a new Randomized Star Sequence
To fully enjoy this randomizer, it's recommended to also download the .bps patch and apply it. It will remove any star requirements for the entire game
