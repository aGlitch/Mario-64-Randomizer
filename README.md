# Mario-64-Randomizer
This program is meant for SM64 races (for now at least). It generates a sequence of Stars that players will try to get as fast as possible. The order of the stars is up to each player.

# How to Use it?
Just download the executable file in the Release section. Double click to run it. Click on "New Seed" to generate a new Randomized Star Sequence. Player/s must collect every star, then beat Bowser to finish the Seed.

To fully enjoy this randomizer, it's recommended to also download the .bps patch and apply it. It will remove any star requirements for the entire game

# Current Version Notes
The Wing Cap Warp is now a warp located where the first Toad was
BBH is a warp located where the Buddy Boo with the Cage was
BitFS is now a warp located against a wall in the DDD / BitFS corridor
