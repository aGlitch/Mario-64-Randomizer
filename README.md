# Mario-64-Randomizer
Program that Randomizes Warps, Objects, Music and even Mario's Clothes. Works with any Romhack and vanilla. It also includes a Sequence Randomizer (works with vanilla only for now).

# How to Use it?

1-Open the Rom you want to randomize
2-Check all the settings that you would want to randomize (from Warps to Mario's Colors)
3-Click on Randomize
4-Save the Randomized rom and enjoy!

To fully enjoy the sequence randomizer (vanilla only), it's recommended to also download the .bps patch and apply it. It will remove any star requirements for the entire game

# Current Version Notes
Vanilla Patch:
BBH is a warp located where the Buddy Boo with the Cage was
BitFS is now a warp located against a wall in the DDD / BitFS corridor
